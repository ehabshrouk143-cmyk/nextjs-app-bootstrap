c## Detailed Implementation Plan for Vintage-Modern Business Website

### Overview
The goal is to create a business website that facilitates marketing emails, sales management, and client calling, with a design aesthetic that blends vintage and modern elements. The website will be built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

### Feature Set
1. **Landing Page**: 
   - Navigation to Marketing Emails, Sales, and Calls sections.
   - Aesthetic design with vintage typography and modern layout.

2. **Marketing Emails Page**:
   - Email composer with rich text editing capabilities.
   - Predefined templates for quick email creation.
   - Recipient management system.

3. **Sales Page**:
   - Client database with search and filter functionalities.
   - Deal tracking and analytics dashboard.
   - User-friendly interface for managing client interactions.

4. **Calls Page**:
   - Client list with calling options.
   - Basic VoIP integration for making calls (UI only for now).
   - Call scheduling feature.

### Step-by-Step Changes

#### 1. Create Main Landing Page
- **File**: `src/app/page.tsx`
  - Implement a navigation bar linking to the three main sections.
  - Use Tailwind CSS for styling and layout.
  - Add a hero section with a compelling tagline and call-to-action.

#### 2. Create Marketing Emails Page
- **File**: `src/app/emails/page.tsx`
  - Implement an email composer using a rich text editor (e.g., Draft.js or Quill).
  - Create a section for managing recipients (add, edit, delete).
  - Use Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring a vintage-modern look.

#### 3. Create Sales Page
- **File**: `src/app/sales/page.tsx`
  - Implement a client database table with search and filter options.
  - Create a dashboard for tracking deals and analytics.
  - Use Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design.

#### 4. Create Calls Page
- **File**: `src/app/calls/page.tsx`
  - Implement a client list with options to initiate calls.
  - Design a basic UI for VoIP integration (placeholder for now).
  - Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

#### 5. Global Layout and Styles
- **File**: `src/app/layout.tsx`
  - Set up global styles and fonts (Google Fonts for vintage-modern typography).
  - Ensure responsive design principles are applied.

- **File**: `src/app/globals.css`
  - Add custom styles for vintage elements (e.g., paper textures, typewriter fonts).

### UI/UX Considerations
- Ensure the website is mobile-responsive.
- Use a color palette that reflects a vintage-modern aesthetic (e.g., muted colors with bold accents).
- Typography should mix serif fonts (for vintage) and sans-serif fonts (for modern).

### Error Handling and Best Practices
- Implement error handling for form submissions (e.g., email sending).
- Validate user inputs on the client-side and server-side.
- Ensure accessibility standards are met (e.g., ARIA roles, keyboard navigation).

### Summary
- Create a landing page with navigation to Marketing Emails, Sales, and Calls sections.
- Develop an email composer, client database, and calling interface.
- Use Tailwind CSS for a vintage-modern aesthetic.
- Implement error handling and accessibility best practices.
- Ensure responsive design for global access.
